    <h2 id="tribute-info">Here's a little information of BMGF:</h2>
    <ul id="list">
      <li><b>1994</b> - The foundation was formed as the William H. Gates Foundation.</li>
      <li><strong>2000</strong> - The Gates foundation was born in 2000 as a merger of two previous charitable endeavours.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="tribute-info">What does the foundation do?</h2>
    <ul id="list">
      <li> Some of its earliest actions included pledges to the Global Fund organisation, which works to eradicate life-threatening diseases such as Malaria and Aids.</li>
      <li> The Gates foundation was also a founding partner of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, created in 2000 to improve immunisation access in poor countries. It has donated more than $4bn to Gavi, which is currently the key player in distributing
        Covid vaccines in developing countries.</li>
      <li>mproving sanitation has became another of the foundation's focuses. Bill Gates has done everything from brandishing a jar of poo on stage to drinking water from distilled faeces, in a bid to reduce stigma and showcase technological
        advances.</li>
      <li>The foundation also does work in the US and says it has funded 20,000 university scholarships for high-achieving, low-income students of colour.</li>
      <li>Headquartered in Seattle, the foundation has paid $54.8bn in grants to initiatives in 135 international countries.</li>
      <li>The endeavour now has more than 1,600 employees in offices around the world - including in Delhi, Beijing and Johannesburg.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="tribute-info">Where does it get its money from?</h2>
    <ul id="list">
      <li> According to the foundation's website, the couple donated more than $36bn (£26bn) of their own wealth to it from 1994 to 2018.</li>
      <li> Another major contributor is US tycoon Warren Buffett, who in 2006 made a lifetime pledge worth more than $30bn to the foundation.</li>
      <li> Together with the investor, the couple launched the Giving Pledge campaign in 2010 - encouraging other rich people to donate the majority of their wealth to good causes.</li>
    </ul>

        What's Next?
More children and young people will survive and thrive thanks to billions of dollars raised to combat infectious diseases that hit the poorest hardest; more women and girls can transform their lives as barriers to economic participation are removed; new crops that can withstand heat, floods and drought will help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change; and students and parents in America can start to make better judgments on the value of going to college.

As I prepare to step down as Chief Executive Officer, it is a moment to reflect on how this—and much, much more—is accomplished thanks to the foundation’s committed staff working every day with our dedicated partners and grantees. It is a great joy to work alongside so many dedicated, talented people, who bring energy, expertise and excellence to some of the world’s toughest challenges.

At the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we believe that all lives have equal value. That means that they not only have equal worth, but equal potential. And that’s why we are committed to doing everything we can to unleash that potential. I might not be leading the foundation through 2020, but I can’t wait to see What’s Next.
